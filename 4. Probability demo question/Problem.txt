Suppose that you want to output 0 with probability 1 / 2 and 1 with probability 1 / 2. At your disposal is a procedure BIASED-RANDOM, that outputs either 0 or 1. It outputs 1 with some probability p and 0 with probability 1 - p, where 0 < p < 1, but you do not know what p is. Give an algorithm that uses BIASED-RANDOM as a subroutine, and returns an unbiased answer, returning 0 with probability 1 / 2 and 1 with probability 1 / 2 . What is the expected running time of your algorithm as a function of p?
