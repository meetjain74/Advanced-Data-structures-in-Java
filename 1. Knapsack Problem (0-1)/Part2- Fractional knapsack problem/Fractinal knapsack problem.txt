Part 2 of the problem -

In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.


Solution -
An efficient solution is to use Greedy approach. 
(1) The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and 
(2) sort the item on basis of this ratio. 
(3) Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we canâ€™t add the next item as a whole and at the end add the next item as much as we can. 
Which will always be the optimal solution to this problem.


Time Complexity - 
same as complexity of sort function
